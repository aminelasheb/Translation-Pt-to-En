# ðŸš€ Exciting NLP Project ! ðŸš€

Hey Github fam! ðŸ‘‹ I'm thrilled to share a recent project where I implemented a neural machine translation model using TensorFlow and the TED Talks translation dataset. This model translates Portuguese to English and is based on the Transformer architecture.


# ðŸ“š Dataset: 
I used the TED Talks translation dataset for Portuguese to English from TensorFlow Datasets.

# ðŸ§  Model:
Implemented a Transformer model for neural machine translation.

# ðŸš€ Highlights:
- Tokenization with TensorFlow Text
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Positional encoding for sequence information
- Training with custom learning rate schedule
- Achieved impressive translation results
